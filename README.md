# Structural-Measures-of-Users

# Authors
This code was developed as a team by Angela Ramirez (aramir62@ucsc.edu) and Ryan Compton (rcompton@ucsc.edu)

# Purpose
This code is meant to iterate through two data sets and build an undirected graph from posting data held within a CSV file. Each file contains rows that hold data for an individual post. 

Each row contains:
- Author UUID
- Date of Post
- Type of tool (Blog or Forum)
- Title of post
- Text of post

Basic structural properities (Centrality, K-Core, Boundary Spanning) of a user is found and written to an outfile
